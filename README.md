These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

I'd highly recommend you try solve these challenges yourself before viewing my solutions, especially since this is all undocumented (and probably badly written) and not meant to be used as a guide.

I'm writing these all in Rust to help learn the language better, and because it gives me some more performance headroom than Python if I decide to use a slow implementation.
